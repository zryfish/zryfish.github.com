这是一首爱尔兰诗人叶芝的诗，感情真诚，语言朴素简明。网上有很多不错的[中文翻译](http://www.douban.com/group/topic/13919022/)。歌手赵照有首同名的改编歌曲，歌词也很不错，基本保留了原诗的韵味，摘录一下。

    When you are old - By WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS  
    
    When you are old and grey and full of sleep,  
    And nodding by the fire, take down this book,  
    And slowly read, and dream of the soft look  
    Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  

    How many loved your moments of glad grace,  
    And loved your beauty with love false or true,  
    But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,  
    And loved the sorrows of your changing face;  
    And bending dow beside the glowing bars,  
    Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled  
    And paced upon the mountains overhead  
    And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

    当你老了 - 赵照  

    当你老了，头发白了  
    睡意昏沉  
    当你老了，走不动了  
    炉火旁打盹，回忆青春  
    多少人曾爱慕你青春欢畅的时刻  
    爱慕你的美丽，假意或真心  
    只有一个人还爱你虔诚的灵魂  
    爱你苍老的脸上的皱纹  

    当你老了，眼眉低垂  
    灯火昏黄不定  
    风吹过来，你的消息  
    这就是我心里的歌  
    当我老了，我真希望  
    这首歌是唱给你的
