### 01-03 : The Economy of Programming Languages

#### 1. Why are there so many programming languages?

 Application domains have distinctive/conflicting needs. It is hard to design one system for all.
 
- Scientific computing. FORTRAN
  - good floating-point support
  - good array support
  - parallelism
- Business applications. SQL
  - persistence
  - report generation
  - data analysis
- Systems programming. C/C++
  - control of resources
  - real time constrains

#### 2. Why are there new programming languages?

Claim: Programmer training is the dominant cost for a programming language.

Predictions:

- Widely used languages are slow to change.
- Easy to start a new language.
  - Productivity > Training Cost => make a switch
- Languages adopted to fill a void
- New languages tend to look like old languages (reduce training cost)

#### 3. What is a good programming language?

There is no universely accepted metric for language design.

A good language is one people use ?
